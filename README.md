Thank you PT. Quantus Telematika Indonesia, for giving me the opportunity to do this QTI Mobile Test. 
In the test that I made, I still don't understand how to connect the API with the project, therefore I apologize and with this I will continue to learn so that I understand better and can run it without any errors.
Thank you very much
